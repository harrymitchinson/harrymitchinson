## Hey, I'm Harry 👋

- 🖥️ I'm currently working as **Lead Platform Engineer @ Mountain Warehouse**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **French** - it's harder than any programming language I've learned so far
- 🤝 I’m looking to help on **open source projects I currently use**
- 💬 Ask me about **kubernetes, golang or cloudflare workers** as they're my favourite, although I know my way around dotnet and node too :)
